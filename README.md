## Description:
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

## How to run it

Using ``make run`` will build the executable and run it.

To run it again without remaking, you can simply run the executable with ``./cub3D`` + path of the map you would like to use.

### Controls

You can move around the maze with ``W`` ``A`` ``S`` ``D``.

You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows ``←`` and ``→``.

To exit the game, press ``ESC`` or click the red cross.
