--- HOW TO RUN:

install glfw (check MLX42 github)
    ➜  ~ brew update
    ➜  ~ brew install glfw
submodules issue:
    (check ssh permission - try cloning on github desktop)
    ➜ git pull --recurse-submodules
    ➜ git submodule update --remote
    ➜ https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42.git



---- THIS WEEKS ISSUES:

(?) 'make cub' prints var 'height' multiple times 
    so it goes 'check_unknown' function 
    and enters while loop 8x 
    then stays in the 9th 
    (to run cub)

(fixed) 'make run' prints 'height' of 21 once and quits 
    now prints 13 just like the other maps
